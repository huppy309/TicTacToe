# TicTacToe

This is a browser based game that 2 players can take turns to play against each other. It is implemented in node.js.

## Usage

To start the game, navigate to the tic_tac_toe/ directory in a linux shell and run the following command. You must have node installed:

```
	node server.js
```

Once the server is running and active, open your browser and navigate to localhost:8000. There must be two tabs, one for each player before the game can begin. Players are required to make moves in their respective tabs. X must move first. Once a game finishes, a new game can be started by reloading the tabs.
